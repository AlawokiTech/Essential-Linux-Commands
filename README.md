## Objective
This documentation manual aims to offer a step-by-step guide on basic Linux commands for users to master a skillset for effective and productive use of the Linux environment. It covers file management, navigation, text editing, and system administration tasks, introducing basic to intermediate commands with explanations, syntax examples, and use cases to enhance your competence in system management using the Linux command line.

# 1. Basic Commands
## 1.1 Navigation and File Operations
Navigation and file operations in Linux involve a set of essential commands that allow users to interact with the filesystem.

### i. 'pwd' Command - Print Working Directory
The `pwd` command displays the current directory's full path.

Syntax: `pwd`

![pwd command](./img/01.png)

### ii. 'ls' Command - List directory contents
The `ls` command lists files and directories in the current directory.

Syntax: `ls`

![ls command](./img/02.png)

For example, `ls -a` displays all files, including hidden ones.

Syntax: `ls -a`

![ls -a command](./img/03.png)

### iii. 'cd' Command - Change directory
The `cd` command allows users to switch directories. If no directory is specified, it defaults to the user's home directory.

Syntax: `cd [directory]`

![cd command](./img/04.png)

### iv. 'cp' Command - Copy files or directories
The `cp` command copies files or directories to a specified location, useful for creating backups or duplicating data.

Syntax: `cp [option] source destination`

Example: `cp filename.txt /path/to/destination/`

![cp command](./img/05.png)

To confirm the file was copied, use the `cd` command to navigate to the destination directory and list the contents with `ls`.

![cp confirmation](./img/06.png)

### v. 'mv' Command - Move/rename files or directories
The `mv` command moves or renames files and directories. If the destination exists, it will be overwritten.

Syntax: `mv [options] source destination`

![mv command](./img/07.png)

Use the `ls` command to verify the `mv` command operation.

![mv confirmation](./img/08.png)

### vi. 'rm' Command - Remove files or directories
The `rm` command deletes files or directories. Multiple files can be removed simultaneously.

Syntax: `rm [options] file(s)`

To remove a single file:
`rm filename.txt`

![rm command](./img/09.png)

To remove multiple files:
`rm file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt`

![rm multiple files command](./img/10.png)

To remove a directory:
`rm -r directoryname`

![rm directory command](./img/10b.png)

To force remove a file or directory without prompting for confirmation:
`rm -f filename.txt`

![rm files/director command](./img/10c.png)

To force remove a directory and its contents without prompting for confirmation:
`rm -rf directoryname`

![rm directory with content command](./img/10d.png)

### vii. 'mkdir' Command - Create a new directory
The `mkdir` command creates new directories. Multiple directories can be created simultaneously.

Syntax: `mkdir directory.name`

![mkdir command](./img/11.png)

Use the `ls` command to verify the `mkdir` command operation.

![mkdir confirmation](./img/12.png)

### viii. 'touch' Command - Create an empty file or update the timestamp
The `touch` command creates an empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing file.

Syntax: `touch file.name`

![touch command](./img/13.png)

Use the `ls` command to verify the `touch` command operation.

![touch confirmation](./img/14.png)

## 1.2 Viewing and Editing Files
Linux offers various commands and text editors to view and edit files. Commands like `cat`, `more`, `less`, `head`, and `tail` are useful for viewing file contents, while `nano` and `vi` are popular text editors for making changes.

### i. 'cat' Command - Concatenate and display file content
The `cat` command reads, combines, and displays file contents.

Syntax: `cat filename.txt`

![cat command](./img/15.png)

### ii. 'more' Command - View file content interactively
The `more` command displays the contents of a file one screen at a time. Itâ€™s useful for large files.

Syntax: `more filename.txt`

![more command](./img/16.png)

Using `more` with a large file:

![more command with large file](./img/17.png)

**Key Navigation for `more` command:**
- Press `Space` to move to the next page.
- Press `Enter` to move to the next line.
- Press `b` to move back one page.
- Press `q` to quit the `more` viewer.

### iii. 'less' Command - View file content interactively with more options
The `less` command allows both forward and backward navigation through a file with advanced features.

Syntax: `less filename.txt`

![less command](./img/18.png)
![less command view](./img/19.png)

**Key Navigation for `less` command:**
- `Space` or `f` to move forward one page.
- `b` to move backward one page.
- `Enter` to move forward one line.
- `y` to move backward one line.
- `n` to repeat the last search forward.
- `N` to repeat the last search backward.
- `q` to quit the viewer.

### iv. 'head' Command - View the first few lines of a file
The `head` command shows the beginning of a file. By default, it displays the first 10 lines.

Syntax: `head filename.txt`

![head command](./img/20.png)

To view a specific number of lines, use `-n` followed by the number of lines:

Syntax: `head -n 20 filename.txt`

![head command with line count](./img/21.png)

### v. 'tail' Command - View the last few lines of a file
The `tail` command shows the end of a file. By default, it displays the last 10 lines.

Syntax: `tail filename.txt`

![tail command](./img/22.png)

To view a specific number of lines, use `-n` followed by the number of lines:

Syntax: `tail -n 20 filename.txt`

![tail command with line count](./img/23.png)

### vi. 'Nano' & 'vi' - Simple text editors
Both `nano` and `vi` are text editors for editing files directly from the terminal.

#### Nano:
To open a file with `nano`, use:

Syntax: `nano filename.txt`

![nano command](./img/24.png)

#### vi:
To open a file with `vi`, use:

Syntax: `vi filename.txt`

![vi command](./img/25.png)

## 2. Intermediate Commands
### 2.1 File Permissions and Ownership
File permissions and ownership in Linux are crucial for controlling access and security.

![chown command](./img/27.png)

### iii. 'chgrp' Command - Change group ownership
The `chgrp` command changes the group ownership of a file or directory.

Syntax: `chgrp group file`

![chgrp command](./img/28.png)

## 2.2 Searching and Finding Files
Finding and searching for files efficiently can be achieved using commands like `find`, `grep`, and `locate`.

### i. 'find' Command - Search for files in a directory hierarchy
The `find` command searches for files in a directory hierarchy.

Syntax: `find [path] [expression]`

![find command](./img/29.png)

### ii. 'grep' Command - Search text using patterns
The `grep` command searches for patterns within files.

Syntax: `grep [options] pattern file`

Syntax: `sudo command`

![sudo command](./img/32.png)

#### ii. Running a Command as a Specific User
